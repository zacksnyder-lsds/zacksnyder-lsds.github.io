##What is Kiva?

- Online Non-profit Service founded in 2005 in San-Francisco
- Facilitate borrowing and lending between users
- loans for small amounts to fund entrepreneurial ventures
- Payments are made back to the initial lender with interest
- Lenders can choose who they would like to fund and for wha

##Who gets the money?

The fundamental question that this brings up is who is served by this lending service? Since the service helps individuals by providing them with funds, we can specify this question further to ask who are lenders choosing to give their money too? This question is fundamental to the mission of Kiva to extend financial access to under-served communities. Correct matching of this question to the mission of Kiva can radically change the lives of individuals without access to the resources needed to escape from poverty otherwise.

##Breaking the question down

This question can be solved using three smaller fundamental questions that make up the whole

- What country gets the most loans
- What sector within those countries get the most loans
- What demographic within those sectors get the most loans

##What Country gets the most loans?

The graph above shows clearly that from the countries Kiva serves, The Philippines by far receives the largest amount of loans. This makes sense given that the Philippines is focusing on improving technology infrastructure (and Kiva being reliant on its users' ability to access technology to apply for loans), while still being a developing country in the process of building new businesses to grow into the future and improve the lives of its citizens.
We can also tell from this graph that all countries receive on average the same loan amount on each loan, except for the United States which is significantly higher.
